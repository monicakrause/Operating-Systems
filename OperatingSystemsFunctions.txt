An operating system manages the hardware and software resources of a system such as the processor, memory, and disk space in desktops. 
This is a very important function since various programs compete with each other for the attention of the CPU, memory, and storage. 
The OS makes sure that each application gets the resources it needs while not interfering with the functions of the other applications.
