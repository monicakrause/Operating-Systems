One function of an operating system is to power a device on when it is off and restart it when it is on (reboot). The start-up process is similar for large and small computers as well as mobile devices. This process includes the power supply or battery sending an electrical current to the circuitry in the computer or mobile device, a series of tests to check various components following a set of start-up instructions contained in firmware. After successful completion of those tests, the kernel of the OS is loaded from the internal storage media to its memory (RAM). The OS in memory then loads the system configuration information and loads the user interface as well as any start-up applications.
Another fuction of an operating system is to provide the user interface (UI). The UI controls how data and your instructions are entered and how information is displayed. User Interfaces can be graphical or command line. UI typically uses a combination of the two to define user interaction with the device.
A third, important function of an operating system, is to manage the programs or applications that are on the device. When an OS is single tasking, the OS allows for only one program or application to run at a time. A multitasking OS, which is what is most commonly seen, allows for multiple programs and/or applications to be in the memory at the same time. When multiple programs are running on  adevice, one program is in the foreground (the active program) while others are in the background (running completely or partially hidden) and the user can switch back and forth between the foreground and background programs.
